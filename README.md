# Real-Time-Eye-Center-Tracking-Computer-Vision
This project was developed for San Francisco State University's Master of Science class Engr-895. This was developed on/for a MAC device. It uses any standard video camera like a webcam to detect and track the eye center/iris of the user closest to the camera.

# Build-Status
Project is completed but the repository in incomplete

# Tech/framework used
OpenCV

# Features
No need of any infrared devices just uses webcam for tracking. Used OpenCV to detect face and eyes of the user. Used relative size of face to determine the closest user to the camera. Programed in Xcode using ObjectiveC++ 

# Output-Restrictions
To get an accurate output make sure the light is facing the users face from behind the camera and the light intensity should be moderate. Ceiling lights wont help. If spectacles are used light glare may reduce the accuracy of the output
